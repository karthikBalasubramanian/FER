    "### Project Overview\n",
    "Facial emotions are important factors in human communication that help us understand the intentions of others. In general, people infer the emotional states of other people, such as joy, sadness, and anger, using facial expressions and vocal tone. According to different surveys, verbal components convey one-third of human communication, and nonverbal components convey two-thirds. Among several nonverbal components, by carrying emotional meaning, facial expressions are one of the main information channels in interpersonal communication. Interest in automatic facial emotion recognition (FER) has also been increasing recently with the rapid development of artificial intelligent techniques, including in human-computer interaction (HCI), virtual reality (VR), augment reality (AR), advanced driver assistant systems (ADASs), and entertainment. Although various sensors such as an electromyograph (EMG), electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalograph (EEG), and camera can be used for FER inputs, a camera is the most promising type of sensor because it provides the most informative clues for FER and does not need to be worn.\n",
    "\n",
    "My journey to decide on this project was exciting. My motive was to compare the performances of Deep neural nets in the contemporary research to heuristically learned pattern recognition methods. Facial emotional recoginition/ pattern recognintion had been in research since long. The following academic papers were very helpful in\n",

    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to showcase two different solutions in solving the problem of Facial emotional recognition from a posed dataset. Both the solutions are based on the problem space of supervised learning. But the first solution I propose is more involved and has more human interference than the second solution which uses state of art artificial neuralnets. The goal is to compare the two approaches using a performance metric - i.e how well the supervised learning model detects the expression posed in a still image. The posed dataset has labels associated with it. The labels define the most probable emotion. After running our two different supervised learning model solutions, I will compare the performance of these solutions using the metrics I define in the next section.\n",

    "1. Data preprocessing - Steps done to create a clean dataset\n",
    "2. Feature Extraction and Normalization methods - The supervised learning approach uses some hand crafted shape prediction methods while the deep neuralnets have data normalization steps. Both these methods are followed by creation of train, valid test set splits\n",

    "\n",
    "But when the dataset is not uniformly distributed across classes we use cross entropy loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Cross entropy loss - Which compares the loss between a vector and a true label in the SVM model.In the deep networks it compares the distance between two vectors. The predicted vector has the probabilities of all the classes. The true vector is a one-hot encoded vector of output labels. The lesser the cross entropy the better the model is. We should also aim at minimizing this loss (i.e closer to 0). In deep learning models, a softmax layer is introduced in the final layer to get the probability vector of classes from the matrix multiplicated computations.\n",

    "I use [Cohn-Kanade dataset](http://www.consortium.ri.cmu.edu/ckagree/). This dataset has been introduced by [Lucey et al](http://www.pitt.edu/~jeffcohn/CVPR2010_CK+2.pdf). 210 persons, aged 18 to 50, have been recorded depicting emotions.Out of 210 people, only 123 subjects gave posed facial expression. This dataset contains the recordings of their emotions. Both female and male persons are present from different background. 81 % Euro-Americans and 13%  are Afro-Americans. The images are of size 640 * 490 pixels as well as 640 * 480 pixels.  They are both grayscale and colored. in total there are 593 emotion-labeled sequences. There are seven different emotions that are depicted. They are:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. 0=Neutral\n",
    "1. 1=Anger\n",
    "2. 2=Contempt\n",
    "3. 3=Disgust\n",
    "4. 4=Fear\n",
    "5. 5=Happy\n",
    "6. 6=Sadness\n",
    "7. 7=Surprise\n",
    "\n",
    "The images within each subfolder may have an image sequence of the subject. The first image in the sequence starts with a neutral face and the final image in the sub folder has the actual emotion. So from each subfolder ( image sequence), I have to extract two images,  the neutral face and final image with an emotion. ONLY 327 of the 593 sequences have emotion sequences. This is because these are the only ones the fit the prototypic definition. Also all these files are only one single emotion file. I have to preprocess this dataset to make it as an uniform input. I will make sure the images are all of same size and atmost it has one face depicting the emotion for now. After detecting the face in the image, I will convert the image to grayscale image, crop it and save it. I will use OpenCV to automate face finding process. OpenCv comes up with 4 different pre-trained  classifiers. I will use all of them to find the face in the image and abort the process when the face is identified. These identified, cropped, resize image becomes input feature. The emotion labels are the output.\n",

    "2. We have a very small dataset per emotion after preprocessing. We had to drop many image sequences as they had no labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we jump into finding solutions to the problem by defining the algorithms, we have to understand the feature extraction process. I will be using standard preprocessing methods in deep learning models as I plan to use transfer learning. I transfer learn the emotions from state of art models like VGG16 and Xception. They have their own pre processing methods. All I have to do is present the image in a format (face identified, cropped, resized image) to get preprocessed to a format that these state of art models want to. But there is a significant education needed to understand the feature extraction process to implement the baseline models.\n",

    "The Feature Extraction process has 2 different phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finding the face - Libraries like dlib has functions like `get_frontal_face_detector` which is handy to identify the face region\n",
    "2. Extracting the features in the face - This is where most of the research in the past has gone into. It has been done so far by realizing through manual interference. One of the method is called Facial Action Coding System (FACS) which describes Facial expression using Action Units (AU). An Action Unit is a facial action like \"raising the Inner eyebrow\". Multiple Activation units when combined expresses the emotion in the underlying face. An example is provided below.\n",

    "The `shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks` above have extracted 67 points in any face in both X and Y axis from the image presented. This X and Y points when combined becomes a Facial Landmark. They describe the position of all the “moving parts” of the depicted face, the things you use to express an emotion. The good thing about extracting facial landmark is that I will be extracting very important information from the image to use it and classify an emotion. But,\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some problems when we directly capture these facial landmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They may change as face moves to different parts of the frame. An image could be expressing the same emotion in the top left pixel as in the bottom right pixel of another image, but the resulting coordinate matrix would express different numerical ranges and hence the two images can be classfied to different emotion instead of the same emotion.Therefore we need a location invariant coordinate matrix to help us classify an emotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to this problem is derived in the following way.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the center of the shap predictor vector\n",
    "2. Calculate the distance between all the shape predictor points to their center\n",
    "3. Calculate the angle at which these points find themselves relative to the center point. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What we now have is the relationship between all the points with the center point and how they are relatively positioned in the 2D space.Each tuple will have the following values `<x, y, distance_from_center, angle_relative_to_center>`. This additional information to each coordinate makes it location invariant. i.e There is a way to derive these points in the 2D system. These becomes features to our baseline models.\n",

    "After several iterations of the parameters in the models, I present the output above. From the given output we can clearly see that none of the tried models is resonable. They have barely learnt emotion other than the skewed Neutral emotion in the hold out test dataset. Accuracy has been a very bad metric to put into evaluation. We can see from the confusion matrix that the models have barely learnt anything. Still due to its non-uniformity, Accuracy has been upto 68%. Data Augumentation has performed horribly. Augumentations to data has greatly affected the loss performance. The models above cannot be trusted for a production usecase. I could not decide on the final model based on the performance results I got.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Justification\n",
    "\n",
    "I declare that my Deep Neural Nets models did not do better than the Baseline SVM models. There are several reasons behind it. I will capture some here. Before that I want to document the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There has been no Final result model identified to compare with the benchmark result.\n",
    "2. I may have not thoroughly analyzed to get to a final solution mostly because I was not aware of ways to navigate to the final solution and partly because I had very little time.\n",
    "3. No significant solution found to the problem than the baseline model. Which performed decently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I could not decide on a solution to the problem via Deep Learning, I will use this section to document what I could have done in finding a solution using Deep Neural nets. Mostly my take is on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I used data augumentation to just augument the existing data. But what I later realized while writing the report is that, I did not enhance/add new images to the dataset. Doing that might have got multiple instances of the same emotion and model might have performed well.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Choice of dataset and constraining myself to taking the peak frames for emotions made me drop many images. I could have labeled last few peak frames to the emotion label rather than naming the penultimate frame the emotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. I could have pivoted to another dataset. The methodology holds valid for any dataset. Cohn-Kanade dataset particulary was `acted out` rather than authentically expressed. Acted facial expressions are usually more exaggerated than what we see in the real world. If we were to classify new images with these models, they would most likely underperform. Systems trained on datasets created in a controlled lab setting generally fail to generalize across datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if I have another chance, I would take a emotions dataset in wild to capture the emotions.\n",

    "### Reflection\n",
    "In this section, you will summarize the entire end-to-end problem solution and discuss one or two particular aspects of the project you found interesting or difficult. You are expected to reflect on the project as a whole to show that you have a firm understanding of the entire process employed in your work. Questions to ask yourself when writing this section:\n",
    "- _Have you thoroughly summarized the entire process you used for this project?_\n",
    "- _Were there any interesting aspects of the project?_\n",
    "- _Were there any difficult aspects of the project?_\n",
    "- _Does the final model and solution fit your expectations for the problem, and should it be used in a general setting to solve these types of problems?_\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize the whole pipeline of the project, I started with identifying a posed dataset which had captured 8 different emotions of the subjects. I defined the metrics to compare, explained the feature extraction methods to be applied in the data preprocessing phase. Then carried out Data preparation where I preprocessed the data, resized and extracted relevant features to form train, test and valid sets. I then applied different algorithms and showcased their performances. Later I stumbled upon problems pertaining to less data and reasoned out the probabale ways I could have resolved them. I did not find one good model to solve the problem of Facial Emotional Recognition but I am confident that this pipleline when enhanced can become a decent tool for the problem. The most interesting aspects of this project to me  was in getting a historic overview of how heuristic pattern recognition methods have taken place so far. Most difficult aspects were in learning the steps that I have to take in improving the model with less data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "There is definitely more work to do to make this project more robust.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf - This paper talks about One-Shot Neural networks. The basic gist is to do Image/Pattern recognition when we have less data. A perfect fit for our problem.\n",
    "2. Exploring out our full pipeline with another dataset which has more datapoints.\n",
    "3. Realtime facial recogition using camera.\n",
    "4. Achieving high accuracy as well as low cross entropy loss across multiple datasets with several variations of features like pose, illumination etc. This makes our pipeline more generalizable.\n",
